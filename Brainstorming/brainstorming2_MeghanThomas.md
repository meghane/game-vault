## App Idea #1 - *The Game Vault*
**What:** This app allows users to find and discover games based on specific genres (such as fantasy, horror, mystery, etc.) and/or types (such as simulation, survival, role-playing, etc.).
**Who:** This app is for any gamer who want to find new games in a specific genre or type of game.
**Why:** With millions of video games available to play, it can be particularly overwhelming when trying to find a game that matches what the user is looking for. This app simplifies the search to make it easier to discover a game they will enjoy. 
**Challenges:** Accessing a reliable and free game database API that provides detailed information. Also, providing a UI that supports an extensive filter tool.
## App Idea #2 - *Recipe Genie*
**What:** This app allows users to input ingredients they have and the app suggests meal ideas based on what is inputted and provides recipes to those as well.
**Who:** This app is great for anyone with any level of cooking skill who is looking to make a meal without having to do any additional grocery shopping.
**Why:** Many people often struggle on figuring out what to cook with the limited ingredients they have. With this app, users can easily input what ingredients they have, and the app will give the user recipes using what's available. 
**Challenges:** I am not too sure how to implement the "choosing" of ingredients the user has, if a list, checklist, select, etc., would be more effective. Additionally, how to effectively filter based on dietary needs and restrictions. 
## App Idea #3 - *Gamepedia*
**What:** This app functions similarly to *Goodreads* but for video games. Users can track their progress in video games, and rate them accordingly.
**Who:** Any gamer who enjoys tracking their gaming progress and leaving reviews.
**Why:** Many gamers enjoy tracking their progress in video games and leaving reviews once they finished, with this app, they can keep all of their progress and reviews in one place.
**Challenges:** Due to not having a community for this app, I am not to sure how many features would be valuable for this app.
## App Idea #4 - *Habit Hub*
**What:** This app allows users to track daily habits (such as drinking water, reading, exercising, etc.).
**Who:** For anyone looking to develop positive habits or break bad ones. 
**Why:** Habit tracking helps countless people to build consistency and motivation in their daily lives. This app will help users stay on track with their wanted habits.
**Challenges:** Finding an API that comes with a pre-determined "list" of habits.
## App Idea #5 - *Film Finder*
**What:** This app allows users to search for movies based on title, genre, release year and more.
**Who:** Movie lovers who want to discover more movies. 
**Why:** This app makes it easy for users to search up films to find out details about it, as well as find a new movie based on a genre picked by the user. 
**Challenges:** Integrating the API, ensuring that movie search results are relevant and accurate.
